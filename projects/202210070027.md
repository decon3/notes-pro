# Equals() preferred over == operator
Code review: CORUPN-4336

```
int coopparam403 = int.Parse(CAControlFile.CoopParameter(403).ToString().Trim(), CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
if (coopparam403.Equals(0))
{
....
}
```

## My Comments
1. Parameter number 403 is hard-coded.  Better to convert the first line into a separate method.  
	* The method name would serve as documentation
	* Coop parameter will be encapsulated in a method
	* The method is testable.
2. Why is "ToString()" required? 
3. If the value is being converted into int, Trim() doesn't make a difference.
4. Why is an intermediate variable required for holding the parameter value?
5. And why is Equals() being used?  'coopparam403 == 0' is more readable.

The code could perhaps be re-written like this:

```
if (CAControlFile.CoopParameter(403).Trim() == "0")
{
....
}
```
