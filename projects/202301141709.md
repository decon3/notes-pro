# Listener - High disk latency causes logging channel to fill up

Following observed at Rutherford:
Logging channel filled up with 450 messages
sar -d showed that there was high latency in one of the disks ('await' column)
```shell
# showing only the last three columns
                             await     svctm     %util

### Resolution:
* Increase log channel capacity (in configuration)
* To reduce disk seeks, write all available messages as one write (instead of one write per message)
* Increase the channel capacity at runtime when the channel is 50% full
	* To avoid resource exhaustion restrict these increases to a configurable limit
	* Allocate a new channel and move all messages from the old channel to the new one
		* To avoid loss of messages, lock all other operations (reads/writes) on the old channel
		* The select command on the channel needs to be re-started; otherwise, the selects will still be listening on the old channel
